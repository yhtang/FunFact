# Summary

`FunFact` is a Python package that aims to simplify the design of matrix and tensor factorization algorithms. It features a powerful programming interface that augments the NumPy API with Einstein notations for writing concise tensor expressions. Given an arbitrary forward calculation scheme, the package will solve the corresponding inverse problem using stochastic gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and multi-replica vectorization. Its application areas include tensor decomposition, quantum circuit synthesis, and neural network compression. It is GPU- and parallelization-ready thanks to modern numerical linear algebra (NLA) backends such as `JAX` [@jax] and `PyTorch` [@pytorch].

# Statement of Need

Tensor factorizations have found numerous applications in a variety of domains [@tbook], [@treview]. Among the most prominent are tensor networks in quantum physics [@tnetwork], tensor decompositions in machine learning [@tensorly] and signal processing [@tml], [@bss], and quantum computation [@qc].

Thus far, most tensor factorization models are solved by special purpose algorithms designed to factor the target data into a model with the prescribed structure. Furthermore, the models that are being used are often limited to linear contractions between the factor tensors such as standard inner and outer products, elementwise multiplications, and matrix Kronecker products. Extending such a special-purpose solver to more generalized models can be a daunting task, especially if nonlinear operations are considered.

`FunFact` solves this problem and fills the gap. It offers an embedded Domain Specific Language (eDSL) in Python for creating nonlinear tensor algebra expressions that are based on generalized Einstein operations. User-defined tensor expressions can be immediately used to solve the corresponding factorization problem. `FunFact` solves this inverse problem by combining stochastic gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and model vectorization for multi-replica learning. This combination achieves instantaneous time-to-algorithm for all conceivable tensor factorization models and allows the user to explore the full universe of nonlinear tensor factorization models. 

![Tensor rank, Tucker, tensor network, and singular value decompositions are among the most popular factorization models that have found numerous applications. However, the popular models that are being studied in the literature only form a small subset of all possible tensor factorization models that can be constructed from generalized contractions, semiring operations, nonlinearities, and more. `FunFact` allows users to probe this vastly larger universe of models through an eDSL for tensor expressions. From the forward computation defined by a tensor expression, `FunFact` can solve the inverse factorization problem using a combination of techniques such as lazy evaluation, automatic differentiation, and stochastic gradient descent.](docs/assets/overview.pdf)

# Functionality

`FunFact`'s core functionality consists of three parts:

1.  A rich and flexible eDSL to express complicated tensor factorization models with a concise expression.
2.  Forward evaluation of user-defined tensor expressions.
3.  Backpropagation and automatic differentiation to compute the model gradients and optimize the factorization model for a target tensor using stochastic gradient descent.


## eDSL for tensor expressions

The central notions in the `FunFact` eDSL are `tensor` and `index` objects that can be used to construct tensor expressions.
Indices are used to label the dimensions of tensor expressions. In an Einstein operation between two tensor expressions, repeated indices are contracted over. Abstract `tensor` objects can be initialized in a two ways: (1) based on their shape, (2) from concrete numerical data.
Optional arguments for `tensor` objects include a label, an `initializer` that provides a generator for a particular distribution, a `condition` that the tensor is expected to satisfy such as nonnegativity and an `optimizable` flag that indicates if the tensor is updated during the optimization process. The `condition` is added as a soft constraint (penalty term) during the optimization process.

Tensor expressions can be indexed, indexless, or hybrid. `FunFact` implements a tensor algebra language model based on a [context-free grammar](https://funfact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/user-guide/cfg/). Index decorators, explicit output index specification, generalized contractions with semiring operations, nonlinearities, and other features make the `FunFact` language both rich and flexible. 

## Forward evaluation

In `FunFact` tensor expressions are handled with a lazy evaluation model: after the user defines their tensor expression, only basic analysis is performed such as shape and dimensionality checking. Instead, the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the expression is stored for later use. Tensor expressions can be explicitly evaluated in the forward direction (from leaf tensors to result tensor) by using the `Factorization` class in `FunFact` which runs the required interpretation on the AST of the input tensor expression to evelatuate it in the forward direction s.
 
## Optimizing for a target tensor

The full capabilities of `FunFact` are used in its `factorize` method, which can use either the `JAX` or `PyTorch` backend to: (1) run the model in the forward direction, (2) run a backpropagation pass with automatic differentiation to find the gradients with respect to a given cost function of the leaf tensors in the AST of the tensor expression model, and (3) update the leaf tensors in a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The `factorize` method allows the user to optimize a model with its structure defined by a tensor expression for a target data tensor, thereby solving the inverse problem. The algorithm can be fine-tuned by the user to optimize its performance for the problem at hand: the learning rate, the optimization algorithm or cost function, the weights of the penalty terms, or any of the other numerous hyperparameters can be set by the user.

# Example

We illustrate the use and flexibility of `FunFact` by providing reference tensor expressions for a few matrix and tensor decomposition models. Upper-case symbols are assumed to be `FunFact` tensors of the appropriate dimensions, lower-case symbols are the corresponding `FunFact` indices.

# Related research and software

`FunFact` is closely related to a few other software packages that provide Einstein notations and Domain Specific Languages (DSL) for tensor algebra. Notable examples are `TensorOperations.jl` [@to] that provides Einstein index notations in julia, `Tensor Comprehensions` [@tc] that provides a DSL to automatically synthesize high-performance machine learning kernels, `einops` [@einops] that enables tensor operations through readable and reliable code, `TACO` [@TACO]: the tensor algebra compiler, and `COMET` [@comet] which is designed for high-performance contractions of sparse tensors. `FunFact` has the unique advantage over all aforementioned projects that it can solve the inverse decomposition problem from the model description as a nonlinear tensor algebra expression. Additionally, `FunFact` offers increased generality compared to other tensor decomposition software libraries such as `Tensorly` [@tensorly], `Tensor Toolbox` [@ttoolbox] or `Tensorlab` [@tlab] which only provide specialized implementations for computing fixed-form tensor decompositions such as Tucker or tensor rank decompositions.
